2025 NFL season lookahead: Commanders among five teams to watch; QB shuffle key storyline - CBS Sports

A week after the Bears defeated the Giants 4-3 in overtime, the Bears will look to bounce back from a 3-0 deficit.

They'll have to go into Saturday's game against the Giants with a 12-0 record as they look to make the playoffs.

"You look at the record, and you've got to get back on track," head coach Marc Trestman said. "You've got to get back on track, and we need to win. But we can't continue to play for such a long time."

The Bears' defense is still a work in progress.

The only time the Bears have had more than 10 sacks is last season when they were fifth in the NFL.

"We've got some things we need to improve on," quarterback Jay Cutler said. "We've got some things we need to improve on. We've got some things we need to improve on. We've got some things we need to improve on. I think we're going to be able to do a better job of that than we did last year."
