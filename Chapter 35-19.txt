A Michigan couple traveled to Mexico for vacation. They ended up in prison over disputed timeshare payments - CNN reports.

"I'm not sure what the judge heard and asked for, but he said, 'We'll make sure that you're not going to pay your bills,'" said the couple's lawyer, Mark D'Agostino.

After a day of meetings with the judge, they settled out of court on Monday.
