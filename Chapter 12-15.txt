Anthony Davis comments for first time after blockbuster trade from Lakers to Mavericks in exchange for Luka Dončić - CNN

"We're in the middle of it. There's a lot of people out there who want to get us out of the Lakers situation, and we'll just give them the benefit of the doubt and just keep it going. We'll keep doing that."

Davis said he did nothing wrong in the trade, but that the Lakers will have to find something to replace him.

"We're going to be on a different level of play than we were last year," Davis said. "We've got some of the best players in the league. But we'll have to find something. I think it's going to be a very exciting season for us and for our fans."

Davis finished his first game since suffering a season-ending knee injury on Nov. 20, but his rookie season ended with a season-ending knee injury, which forced him back to the bench and ultimately to the practice squad.

The Lakers are scheduled to open training camp Sunday at the Lakers' practice facility in L.A.
