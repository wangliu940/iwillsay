Colorado soldier behind Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion described wake up call in writings, police say - The Denver Post reports

"I was trying to figure out what to do, and what to do not to do. It was pretty scary, I guess," said John J. Campbell, 20, of Las Vegas.

Campbell has been living with his wife and children for the past decade in the area.

The family is still trying to figure out what happened and what to do.

Campbell said he had gone to the store to pick up his wife and children, but when they arrived he was "surprised and scared."

Campbell said he then went to the pharmacy to buy some marijuana, but when they saw that it was empty, he grabbed his wallet and called 911.

"They said 'the store is empty, we have to get out,'" said Campbell. "I started screaming, 'I'm a criminal, I can't have anyone here.' I'm like, 'I'm at the same store.' I was like, 'Wow, it's OK, I was out of the store."

Cannabis is not legal in Colorado. The state recently passed a law to allow marijuana in recreational stores.

The situation is similar to one in Las Vegas, where a man died after a man crashed his car into a crowd of about 300 people.

The woman's boyfriend was arrested but was released at the scene.
