Tesla delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 for the first time in years - The Washington Post's Josh Dawsey reports.

The U.S. economy is expected to pick up next year, with inflation expected to grow 2.7% this year and 1.9% in 2024.

The report adds that the U.S. economy, which is expected to grow at a sluggish 2%, will grow at a 3% pace next year.

The report also says that U.S. automakers will have to spend at least 30% more on new models than they spend on its current model.

"We are on track to meet our target to build a new decade in the U.S. in one of the most conservative years in the past decade, which will be a hard-fought effort for most of the automakers and auto manufacturers," the report says.
