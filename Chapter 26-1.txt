LA fire chief says city failed residents in wildfire prep, budget cuts: 'Screaming to be properly funded' - Fox News

A wildfire in Texas destroyed a home and an office building in southwestern Texas, a Houston Fire Department spokesman said Tuesday.

The fire, which began in the Little River Valley on Sunday, was sparked by a recent string of fires in the northern part of the state.

"Our crews are still in the building and we're going to see what's going to happen," Deputy Chief Mike Davis said.

The fire is estimated to be contained to the Little River, about 50 miles west of Houston, Davis said.

The fire started at 6:30 p.m. local time, but was contained by 10:20 p.m. local time.

Davis said the fire is expected to be contained by 5:30 a.m. Friday.

About 50 firefighters were battling the blaze, which began near a home on Greenfield Road, and were expected to be contained by Friday, said Lt. Jeff Clements, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety.

The fire started about 8:20 p.m., he said, and was contained by about 10:30 p.m. local time.

The fire spread from the Little River Valley to the northern Texas city of Garland, and into a residential area, Clements said.

The fire was under control around 8 a.m., and the department still was in the process of analyzing the incident, Clements said.

Clements also said there are no plans to fire a single flare in Texas.
