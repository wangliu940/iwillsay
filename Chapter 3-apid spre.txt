Rapid spread of H5N1 bird flu through California dairy herds suggests unknown paths of transmission - STATUS: Wild bird flu virus.

"This study shows that the most prevalent pathogen has a very long-term reservoir in the wild and that this bird flu virus has been found to be spread in California's dairy herds and some other regions of the state," said study co-author Michael O'Neill, of Oregon State University in Eugene. "It's a very exciting time for agriculture."

The study has been published in the journal Nature.

The research team is led by Dr. Richard O'Neill, a professor of biology and of ecology at Oregon State University, and investigators from the Oregon Department of Agriculture's Institute of Biological Sciences.

"We don't anticipate that this bird flu virus is going to be here for many years," he said.

O'Neill said while he is proud to be a part of this research, he also hopes to see the effects of the bird flu virus in the future. This is one of the study's three main findings.

"We have identified the pathogen that is responsible," he said. "We know that the bird flu virus is a key component of this virus, but when we look at how it spreads, we
