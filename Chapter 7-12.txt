3. The Cretaceous Sea-Turtles Are Back from Extinction

This time, it's a different story. The Cretaceous Sea Turtle (Cretoplasma arctum) was one of the most endangered of all the large predators, having lost its habitat in the early Cretaceous and living on land about 100 million years ago. Now it's returning with the help of a group of scientists from the University of Texas at Austin.

The team of seven scientists from the University of Texas at Austin and the University of California, Berkeley have used a combination of aerial and underwater photography to learn where the turtle population is in the Cretaceous. They found that the turtle's habitat is "largely protected," from the high seas to the Gulf of Mexico, and more than half of the turtle's population has been lost in the last few decades.

"This is a great opportunity to be able to look at the Cretaceous Sea Turtle's health, because it's a very important part of our understanding of the Cretaceous," said researcher Dr. Susan J. Bell, a postdoctoral fellow in the University of Texas at Austin's Department of Marine Science.

The team's research is published in the journal PLOS ONE.
