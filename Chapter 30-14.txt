Judge blocks Trumpâ€™s executive order ending federal support for DEI programs - The Associated Press


Trump's executive order bans the use of funds for the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) DEI Program, which was designed to help the federal government "detect terrorist threats and provide critical information to law enforcement and public safety."

The decision by the D.C.'s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is the latest in a series of moves by the Trump administration to halt funding for the program, which was established under Obama's predecessor, Barack Obama.

The D.C. Board of Deputies on Dec. 1 also approved the President's Executive Order. The move is likely to change the course of federal policy.

On Friday, Trump defended the order and said that it was a "great, great announcement from the president to the American people."

"I'm not going to lie to you," Trump said, "I think it is one of the great accomplishments of our time."

Trump said the D.C. Board of Deputies was "the last person I will ever have to deal with."

Trump said that DHS should not be allowed to divert funds to other federal agencies.

"I am going to have to do what's necessary to keep our country safe," he added.
