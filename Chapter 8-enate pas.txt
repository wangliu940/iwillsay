Senate passes Social Security benefits boost for many retired public service workers - PBS NewsHour

Cork's new plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour would save hundreds of public servants, including those who work at the state's public service, $4,900 a year, and up to $5,000 a year in future years, according to new results released Wednesday.

It would also raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2019 and will be repealed by the General Assembly from July 1, the latest in a series of tax increases enacted by the new governor.

The plan, which would raise the state's minimum wage to $15 by 2019 and will be repealed by the General Assembly from July 1, the latest in a series of tax increases enacted by the new governor, would mean that the state would lose $1.5 billion a year, or $2.6 billion in annual revenue.

The increase would cost the state $2.4 billion in the 2018 fiscal year and $2.8 billion in 2019.

The measure would also create a new tax credit for people earning more than $65,
