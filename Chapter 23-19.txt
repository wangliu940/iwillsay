First U.S. H5N1 Death Sparks Urgency: Scientists Warn That Bird Flu Is Mutating Faster Than Expected - SciTechDaily

As the U.K. is hit hardest by the flu season, scientists say they're taking a more cautious approach.

According to the U.K.'s health service, around 4.5 million people are under the age of 20, most of them children.

The flu season is one of the most intense in the world.

The flu vaccine is needed to prevent infection in up to seven people infected with the virus, and researchers say the disease can spread like wildfire.

Health experts say the flu season should be extended for at least a year and then spread to more people.

"We want people to be aware of this season and to take precautions," said Dr. James Hochman, a virologist at the University of Arizona Medical Center.

Researchers say the flu season has already started.

"We're beginning to see a surge in the number of people experiencing symptoms of flu and the number of people being exposed to the flu virus," said Dr. John Hochman, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Hochman says the flu season is likely to be shortened this year.

"It's not just the flu season, it's the season of the summer and winter," Hochman said.

Dr. Jonathan Paz, a health epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, says the health care system needs to act fast.

"They need to act fast. They need to act fast on this epidemic," Paz said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says we must do more to prevent the spread of the flu.

The CDC says the flu season is a natural part of the population.

"One of the big questions is how are the individuals getting the flu?" said CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden.

Frieden said there's a lot of evidence to suggest people who have been exposed to the flu might not have the flu.

"But there's also evidence that the risk for the flu season is very high, which could indicate it's becoming more common
