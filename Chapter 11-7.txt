Apple's CEO Tim Cook says the company is "shifting gears" and that the world's largest company is focused on delivering its products to the consumer.

The company will hold a press conference in San Jose, California, on Tuesday to announce plans to launch the iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 this year.

Cook made the announcement during a keynote address at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California.

He said Apple is moving ahead with a "hardest job of the last 20 years. We are moving forward in a very important way. We're now moving at a faster pace than the world has seen before."

Cook went on to say that Apple is focusing on quality hardware that delivers the same performance and reliability as Apple's competitors.

"We're continuing to focus on innovation that's good for the company as a whole and that really, really benefits the business," Cook said.

The keynote address was delivered by Apple's Chief Technical Officer Steve Jobs, who is the son of former Apple executives and Apple founder Steve Jobs, who died in September.

"We also believe that the world's most competitive mobile platform is going to be the one that will be the new iPhone," Jobs said.

Cook said the company will also be launching its first smartphone, the iPhone 7, which will be available in the Fall.

He also announced that Apple will be making the first iPhone 6, which will be available in the fall.

The company is also expected to unveil the next generation of high-end mobile devices in September.

The CEO revealed that Apple will also be releasing the iPhone 6 Plus today for pre-order, and that the iPhone 7 will go on sale in the Fall, just in time for the company's quarterly earnings call next year.

A preview of the iPhone 6s will be unveiled at a later date.
