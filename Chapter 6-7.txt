What's next for the Bears?

The Bears are in a playoff spot. They're going to need to win the next three games, and they have a lot of talent. But they're on the verge of a win over the 49ers, which could be their biggest challenge.

Devin Bowlen's not the only one that's making an impact. The Arizona Cardinals have a lot of talent on their roster. Defensive end Zach Ertz is one of the best. Even though the Cardinals are so talented, they're not the strongest pass defense in the country. They need to step up and push for more.

The Colts are a playoff team that will need an explosive offense to stop the run. They have to step up and push for more.
