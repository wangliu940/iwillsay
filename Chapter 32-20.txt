Researchers find AI is pretty bad at debugging—but they’re working on it - Ars Technica (@ashtica) October 23, 2016

It's not just that humans are not always smart. If robots are working, it means they are even more likely to be in trouble.

There's a reason why you might think AI isn't as bad as it is.

If you are in a situation where the human being is not always able to do the right thing, robots are just as likely to be useless or even dangerous as the humans they're working with.

That's why it's important that we work to improve AI. That means improving the way we work. We've got to improve the way we interact with a computer.

There is a simple solution: make a robot the world's most efficient and most intelligent human.

Automation is one of the best ways humans will become better at interacting with computers, and it's why we're getting better at this.

It's time to invest in robot learning.

If you want to make a robot more intelligent, you need to invest in training its human brain.

If you want to make a robot harder to train, you need to invest in training its human brain.

If you want to make a robot more human, you need to invest in training its human brain.

This isn't just about keeping AI as simple as possible. You should make it so that we can train a robot to be more human.

The way we train robots will help us improve the way we work.
