Trump loses appeal in $5 million E. Jean Carroll defamation, sexual abuse case - The Washington Post

U.S. District Judge William F. Wilmerstein's decision means the case is now closed, and the government will have to pay $50 million to settle the civil suit.

A federal judge in Manhattan will hear the case in January, and the government will also have to pay $50 million to settle a lawsuit from three former students who claimed their teacher sexually abused them while working as a bookseller in the 1980s.

The class action lawsuit against the school district and the three students was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union earlier this year.

The case, which was brought by the students, is now set for trial in December, according to the New York Times.

A trial date has been set for Feb. 16.

The New York Times reported that Wilmerstein's decision was based on "an analysis of the evidence in the case that indicates that the district has improperly used, and abused, its influence over the behavior of its students in the classroom and in the classroom of its principals."

School district spokeswoman Julie Brown said in a statement that the district has "fully cooperated with the government and will continue to do so."
