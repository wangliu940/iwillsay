Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on autos, chips and pharmaceuticals - CNN reports.

China is the top creditor of the US dollar, so the deal gives the Chinese government $20 billion in annual income tax revenues.

The deal could also include a new currency, which could help the US dollar trade with China, and potentially help the Chinese economy, according to a report from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC).

It is unclear whether the deal will be signed as soon as next month, however.

The deal comes after US President Donald Trump said in December that China should be banned from the US dollar, but it is unclear whether this will be the case for the next five years.

The new agreement "will greatly strengthen China's position in the world economy, and it will also increase the leverage with the US," the APEC report said.

The pact comes after the US State Department released a report stating that China has a "significant trade deficit with the United States" and that "the US should not be able to influence the outcome of the negotiations of the Bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership (CIPP)."
