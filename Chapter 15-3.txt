Democrat Jared Golden's only tariff fear: That Trump will back down - Axios

A former White House official said that Trump will be "very aggressive" in his "hateful" attack on the Muslim-American community.

"I'm sure that, if he gets to this point and gets to a point that he's willing to go to, it will be very aggressive, he'll be very aggressive," said the former official.

Trump is likely to push back on Fox News and other major conservative papers that he claims are biased against him.

Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, who has been slammed over allegations of sexual harassment on the air, was recently fired after she called on him and his wife, Melania, to drop their children from a high school graduation party.

Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
