'The international community must work together' to end Syria's war - DW (English)

Syria has been engulfed in a civil war since the 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime began.

The war has killed more than 3 million people, displaced 6.5 million people and displaced about half a million people since 2011.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Saturday that at least 2,000 people were killed in the conflict between government forces and the rebels, and at least 4,000 civilians were injured.

Syria's top opposition leader, Riad Hadi, told the BBC on Sunday that the fight against the rebels was "long and bloody."

"We hope that the international community will work together to end the war and to protect and restore the country's stability," he said at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

The violence started when the government of President Bashar al-Assad's regime began to withdraw from parts of the country, with the military saying it would not retreat.

The UN, which has no jurisdiction over Syria, has warned the rebels that the war is a war crime and crimes against humanity.

The UN said it had been "shocked and angered" by the violence, and that it "seems to be escalating the situation in Syria."
