Why Saudi Arabia is the venue of choice for Trump talks on Ukraine - BBC.com

US President Donald Trump has said he is "very concerned" by reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the deaths of Russian opposition leader Sergei Ivanovich and urged him to stay in his country for an answer.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Mr Trump's remarks were "disgraceful", but the US president had not commented on the reports.

He said Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted Mr Trump to stay - and urged him to stay because Mr Trump is the only US president to have been elected president since Ronald Reagan.

Mr Lavrov told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Trump should stay because his "presidential instincts are very strong".

"I don't want him to go into Ukraine - he's a very good president. I've always said that, we need a president who has been in power, someone who has looked after his own people," Mr Lavrov said.

Mr Lavrov said Mr Trump had a "very strong relationship" with Russia and would do everything in his power to protect them.

"He is very respected by the Russian people. And a lot of countries are very interested in him because he's a strong leader who respects them very strongly," he added.

Mr Lavrov said Mr Trump had said he would be "very interested" in seeking a new round of US-Russia relations.
