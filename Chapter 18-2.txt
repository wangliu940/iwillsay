After a Project-Packed 2024, Nicole Kidman Says This Year Will Be “Not as Crazy” - Hollywood Reporter

The next few years will see a lot of different changes to the Hollywood entertainment landscape. We now live in an era where the big studios are the ones who control our daily lives, and that means we have to constantly work to get the best possible performance out of our characters.

That's why a lot of actors are starting to take on the role of the more "traditional" roles, but I don't see how this will be the most popular for many actors. For example, I'm sure the likes of James Franco, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Daniel Radcliffe are also going to have to get their own movie roles, but I don't see any actors who are so desperate to be a part of something as big as an Oscar nomination that they'll simply do it for free.

That's why I'm very excited that we'll see new roles for all of the current stars in this year's Academy Awards. Let's see who we can expect to make the cut at the box office.
